                <h3>E-Commerce Website</h3>
                <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Built an E-commerce website with a fully functioning authentication system and a payment

                <h3>Marvel Website</h3>
                <h4>Front End Developer</h4>
                <p>
                    Built a frontend website on the Marvel Cinematic Universe using HTML, CSS and 
                    Javascript. The website consits of multiple pages and each page contains information 
                    about the Marvel Cinematic Universe from the characters to their comic books along with
                    the future prospects of the Universe.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    There is also a feature to SNAP! out half of the characters of the universe with a 
                    single click which is a fun little easter egg for all the fans out there.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The website displays my frontend skills as a developer as each page has a unique 
                    background and has a different tone to it pertaning to the specific page.
